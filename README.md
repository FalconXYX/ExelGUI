# ExelGUI
Takes data from a exel spreadsheet and graphs it 
The first file is the simple text version,
the second version allows you to choose how many countries you want to graph through check boxes 
the third file is a commented version that work well as a template.
The statistics that ere used are from https://stats.oecd.org/ and are in no way mine.
